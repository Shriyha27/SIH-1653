## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
```
A Tech-Enabled Interview Assistance System (TIAS) that simulates a real-life boardroom and assists experts in conducting structured interviews. 
The system includes:

1. AI-Powered Question Generator

Generates dynamic questions based on candidate’s expertise, past experience, and job role.
Categorizes questions into:
Ice-breaking
Technical/Managerial
Behavioral

2.Automated Relevance Scoring for Questions & Responses

Each question is scored based on relevance to the candidate’s domain.
Each response is graded based on:
Technical Depth
Clarity & Coherence
Relevance to the Question

3.Interview Panel Dashboard

Allows experts to modify questions, see AI-suggested relevance scores, and input their own evaluations.
Displays real-time candidate performance analytics.

4. Candidate Performance Analytics

Computes an overall suitability score based on:
Question relevance
Response quality
Domain expertise
```
